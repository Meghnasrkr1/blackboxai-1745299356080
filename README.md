# Aircraft Management System

## Project Overview
The Aircraft Management System is a web application designed to efficiently manage information related to aircraft, maintenance records, flights, and crew members. The system is built using HTML and CSS, enhanced with Tailwind CSS for responsive design and styling. It provides a structured overview of various aircraft, their maintenance schedules, flight details, and crew assignments, facilitating better management and operational efficiency for aviation enthusiasts and professionals.

## Installation
To run the Aircraft Management System locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aircraft-management-system.git
   cd aircraft-management-system
   ```

2. **Open the project**: 
   Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

There are no additional installation steps necessary as this project is a purely front-end static application.

## Usage
After opening `index.html`, the main interface will display several sections related to aircraft management:
- **Aircraft**: Lists different models of aircraft along with their manufacturers, capacities, and registration numbers.
- **Maintenance Records**: Logs all maintenance activity for each aircraft, including dates and descriptions of work done.
- **Flights**: Provides information on scheduled flights with details such as flight number, origin, destination, and timing.
- **Crew Members**: Displays a list of crew members along with their roles (e.g., pilots and flight attendants).

You can navigate through each section using the navigation links provided in the header.

## Features
